	<h3>First App for j3qUE</h3>
	
	<p>Since Sunday I have been working maniacally on a 2D framework that can be used to control my 3D apps. 
		I am calling this framework j3qUE - pronounced jay-three-cue-eee. The name derives from the combination of JavaScript, Three.js, jQuery UI and user experience.
		While it's not much, 'Happy Birth Yay Alix!' is the first app I have built using j3qUE.
		And I dedicate the app and the project to my daughter Alix. </p>
