Joyeux Anniversaire a la plus belle des Alix; je te souhaite beaucoup de belles aventures, d'eclairs au chocolat ou au cafe, d'arcs-en-ciel pour colorer les jours pluvieux, d'idees aussi brillantes que tes lampes... <br />
<br />
Here are just some of the reasons of why you are one of our/my favorite people, 27 reasons to celebrate who you are on your birthday<br />
<br />
1- Your incredibly creative mind, always on a roll, always imagining new worlds and products<br />
2- Your sense of adventure and how willing and eager you are to start new ones<br />
3- Your sense of motivation, which is truly inspiring<br />
4- How silly and funny you can be when you don't take yourself seriously<br />
5- Your dancing abilities! True rock star on the dance-floor<br />
6- Your amazing sense of style, always looking so pretty and put-together<br />
7- Your deliciouuus chocolate souffles mmh<br />
8- Your musical taste!<br />
9- Your strong hands that give good (but rough!) massages<br />
10- Your ever-lasting desire to learn new things, languages, skills<br />
11- How organized you are!<br />
12- Your curiosity and willingness to test and try everything (food, clothing styles, nail polish or lipstick colors, home redecoration etc)<br />
13- Your great volleyball skills!<br />
14- The fact that you cant steal my clothes because you're too tall!<br />
15- The fact that you're tall enough to protect me from anything!<br />
16- Your cheerful mood<br />
17- Which goes with your most beautiful smile :-)<br />
18- You're not too attached to material things making it easy for you to redecorate apartments without the guilt of getting rid of things of the past<br />
19- Your optimism!<br />
20- Yet how down to earth you are, even with your optimism you keep your goals rational and clear<br />
21- Your love of food, people and clothes has inspired my love of food, people and clothes!<br />
22- How much and how hard you strive to always be your best<br />
23- Your ability to balance so many projects and also keep a social life<br />
24- You're not afraid to take risks<br />
25- You're not afraid to be bold either! It comes naturally to you<br />
26- How beautiful you are, inside and out<br />
27- Your amazing and communicative laugh<br />
<br />
Obviously the list goes on, but it's just a little reminder that you are a wonderful person and you don't have to throw a party or even a simple get-together if you don't want to, because your age doesn't define who you are. <br />
<br />
And you are an incredible person and a amazing sister. <br />
<br />
I miss you so much and would give the world to be with you, to be able to hug and kiss you and let you know how much you mean to me. <br />
<br />
So enjoy today, hopefully you'll be getting my card soon, and I'm sending you 50euros on Paypal for your packaging prototype for the Akina lamps (or the blue scarf with dots+mascara if thats what you prefer!)<br />
I love you so much, happy birthday!<br />
