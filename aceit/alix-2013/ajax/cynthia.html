Well, no way for me to send out a cuter and more touching email than Eloise's...<br />
<br />
:) I hope you are having a great time. As she said, it really doesn't matter how you celebrate your birthday. The adventures and nights out and fun all year long make up for anything! <br />
<br />
Can't wait to be there in June with Eloise so we can properly celebrate and go out and be sun lazy crazy!! <br />
<br />
Happy birthday Alix!!! I look forward to talking to you tonight!! <br />
