Vision Mission Values Strategies
================================

## Vision
This project is a cradle for new projects and a cemetary for projects that never wen anywhere.

## Mission
Viable, on-going value-adding projects grow womderfully 

## Values
The work is open source. 
The code built for dummies.

## Strategies
The code does for free what used to cost thousands
The code just works, nothing to dowkoad, nothing to install

## Tactics
The code is easy to find via Google and access


## Goals
Code and repositoies have descriptive names

## Topics
Math 
AEC
Character Animation/BVH
HID
Patterns/ Ontologogy
Absence
Cartography


## FGx: Three vaild projects

## FGx Vision: To be a supplier of great stuff that helps Internet airpeeps to fly further, safer and faster

## FGx Mission: FGx provide models and data that is FOSS, easily accessible  

### Project 1. FGx Aircraft Repository

3D models of all significant aircraft

Aircraft follow a recognized system oh momemvlature or naming
3D models are available in a variety of formats and detail
Aircraft data is GPL licensed

## FGx Terrain Elevation Bitmaps

#### Objective: Make 3D terrain elevation data readily, reliably and rapidly available

#### Tactic: Make available the 90MB of bitmaps with DEM data down to 7.6 second accuracy


### Project 3. FGx Airports Runwaya annd Navaids

### Objective: Make available the locations and basic specification of the world's airports and and air navigation aids

### Tactic: suck the data out of x-plane's files, the FAA and whereever and amake ti available on GitHub

## FGx Not Do List
