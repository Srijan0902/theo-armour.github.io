## Concept
<a href="http://jaanga.github.io" target="_blank">Jaanga.github.io</a> is a GitHub organization 
with source code at <a href="https://github.com/jaanga" target="_blank">github.com/jaanga</a>.

The name 'Jaanga' was chosen because it sounds jazzy, it is short and search results indicate uniqueness.

Much of my recent work is available here - including the following projects:

		
* <a href="http://jaanga.github.io/gestification/" target="_blank">Gestification</a> ~ work that involves Three.js and the Leap Motion device. 
<a href="https://github.com/jaanga/gestification" target="_blank">Source</a>.
		
* <a href="http://jaanga.github.io/algesurf" target="_blank">algeSurf</a> ~ mathematics with a 3D perspective. 
<a href="https://github.com/jaanga/algesurf" target="_blank">Source</a>.
		
* <a href="http://jaanga.github.io/urdacha" target="_blank">Urdacha</a> ~ entry for the Swiss Center _Urban Data Challenge_.
